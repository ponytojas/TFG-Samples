# TFG - Samples

This is a simple repository to save and deploy my Final Degree Project (TFG in Spanish) samples.

For now, only in spanish, sorry 

You can see a live preview [in Netifly](https://tfg-samples.netlify.app/)


## :hammer: Deploy

If you want to deploy it locally you can do it by following this simple steps.

> npm install
